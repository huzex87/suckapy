He has just tonight survived a terrible accident on the Bo Highway whilst transporting blood samples of suspected Ebola cases from Freetown. The ambulance was damaged reportedly beyond repairs; Windscreen, windows, steering wheel, everything, damaged. The driver and Lab technician Samba who were in the ambulance are both alive but with body pains. They are presently at Bo Government hospital. I have just spoken to Samba. He is such a brave patriot. Sadly, his money was looted at the scene whilst he laid unconscious. He is a brave guy whom, with the driver, has been involved in transporting these suspected samples for weeks now. God bless them. Meanwhile, the suspected Ebola samples were un-affected as Samba had professionally packed them using a shock proof method. They have already been forwarded to Kenema and received by the lab out there.\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sylola/posts/746412578755508 \n\nhttp://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200525797.shtml"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-13.220103979110718,8.485562464986423]},"properties":{"_storage_options":{"iconClass":"Drop","color":"DeepPink"},"description":"July 15 2014 \n\nPhoto of the Arwa Clinic:\n{{http://gdb.voanews.com/2B907C9C-15E7-49E1-A92A-326191C055B2_w640_r1_s_cx0_cy3_cw0.jpg}}\nin this article:\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ebola-death-toll-surpasses-600-in-west-africa-/1957756.html\n\nJuly 12 2014 \n\nFrom the Kissy chiefdoms in the East, to Kissy Road in Freetown the West of Sierra Leone, where the Arab Clinic of number 120 kissy road has been shut down, and all it staffs detained by the police, for allegedly administering medication to an Ebola victim.\n\nThe suspected cases include the Arab owners, a Guinean doctor and several Sierra Leonean nurses ( who are all currently being held custody).\n\nThe victim was said to have come from somewhere around Kenema and seek their medical attention, they treated him for malaria and typhoid, and then allowed him to live, since its a clinic that does not admit people.\n\nMeanwhile the entire building, which also comprise residence, has been close, and police are currently securing it surrounding.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/sl.issues/permalink/695422913826833/\n\nMOHS July 11 2014 \nThe Western Area confirmed case came from Kenema to seek medical care in Freetown\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=317611755082340&id=281064805403702\n\nThe unidentified Egyptian national had traveled from Kenema, the largest city in the nationâ€™s Eastern Province, and checked into a clinic east of Freetown, Sidie Yahya Tunis, director of Information, Communication and Technology at the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, said by phone today.
