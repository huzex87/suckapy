He bemoaned the “negative attitude” of suspected cases and warned that their flight could be risky and a reason for rapid spread of the disease across the country.\n\nAmong those suspected to be on the run were Senessie Konneh, Baindu Kamanda, Samuel Lamin, Moudy Konneh and Luya Brima, he announced, adding that they were all from the same Jembeh community in the Bo district.\n\n(C) Politico 15/07/14 - By Bob Batilo Saffa in Kenema\n\nhttp://politicosl.com/2014/07/5-ebola-suspects-on-the-run-in-bo/","name":"Jembeh: At least one suspected dead case. 5 Ebola suspected cases in Bo."}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11.323986053466797,7.310027978584256]},"properties":{"description":"July 15 2014 \n\nIn press:\nhttp://politicosl.com/2014/07/ebola-kills-one-in-pujehun-southern-sierra-leone/\n\nOn Facebook: (Many cases):\n\" THERE ARE LOTS OF SUCH CASES WHO HAVE DIED WITHOUT BEING COUNTED\"\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/sl.issues/permalink/697889393580185/\n\n\nJuly 11 2014 (citizen on Facebook)\n\nOne Ebola death reported by the Pujehun DHMT today July 11 2014 at Zimmi Makpele. It is reported that the person returned to Zimmi after losing a close relative\\spouce to the EVD in Kenema. Residents stormed their residence in a bid to QUARANTINE their house until they are all taken to Kenema treatment centre. The situation was tense but now under control. Wanjama people were advised to stay calm! I went to Kenema and back today and applaud the Medical team at Bandama Check Point who are up to the task of taking personal data and body temperature of EVERYONE passing through the check point. My body temp was 36.6.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sylola/posts/743242282405871?comment_id=743395422390557&offset=0&total_comments=39 \n\n July 12 2014 \n\n\"The suspected Ebola death at Zimmi Makpele (Pujehun) was not \"professionally disposed of\"!
