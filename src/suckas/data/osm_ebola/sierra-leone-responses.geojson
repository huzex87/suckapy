He has just tonight survived a terrible accident on the Bo Highway whilst transporting blood samples of suspected Ebola cases from Freetown. The ambulance was damaged reportedly beyond repairs; Windscreen, windows, steering wheel, everything, damaged. The driver and Lab technician Samba who were in the ambulance are both alive but with body pains. They are presently at Bo Government hospital. I have just spoken to Samba. He is such a brave patriot. Sadly, his money was looted at the scene whilst he laid unconscious. He is a brave guy whom, with the driver, has been involved in transporting these suspected samples for weeks now. God bless them. Meanwhile, the suspected Ebola samples were un-affected as Samba had professionally packed them using a shock proof method. They have already been forwarded to Kenema and received by the lab out there.\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sylola/posts/746412578755508\n\nActionAid UK - Reported July 14 2014 \n\n#Ebola has reached Bo District, Sierra Leone, where nurses Mary Angela and Aminta Thoronka work in a birth waiting home built with support from ActionAid.
