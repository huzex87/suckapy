All public health facilities have areas referred to as observation units where suspected cases of Ebola are kept until their test results are out. These observation units are nowhere near the normal wards where other patients are kept while undergoing normal treatment and care. The case been referred to was kept in the Observation unit at PCMH while her blood sample was taken to the Kenema Lassa Laboratory for the Ebola test. The test result came out negative and that patient was longer considered suspected Ebola case. The information on the social media purporting a positive Ebola case that escaped from an observation unit at the Cottage Hospital in Freetown is therefore false and unfounded.\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=321668521343330&id=281064805403702 \n\n July 21 2014 \n\nhttp://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200525813.shtml\n\n July 19 2014 \n\"A suspected Ebola patient has escaped from Isolation at PCMH Cottage, Fourah Bay Rd in Freetown.\"\n\"Esteemed members of SIERRA LEONE ISSUES, well the \"gullible\" people are not only in Kissi Teng, Kailahun. Tonight, credible reports are that a suspected Ebola patient has escaped from Isolation at PCMH Cottage, Fourah Bay Rd in Freetown with help of her friends and family. She was reportedly admitted in isolation whilst waiting for her test results from Ebola lab in Kenema. Well, to cut a long story short, she was forcibly removed from the Isolation room and then, was put onboard an okada motorbike and whisked off to her residence somewhere in Freetown. One of the nurses on duty was seriously SLAPPED for attempting to stop the escape.\nEnti na Kissi Teng, Kailahun, some bin day cuss \"munku\" and \"gullible\"?\nWaytin na MUNKU?
