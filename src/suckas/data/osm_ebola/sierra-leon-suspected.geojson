The victim’s girlfriend who happened to be a nurse residing at New England Ville was also found to be Ebola positive according to the sources.\n\n“Both of them have since been transferred to the Kenema Ebola treatment center,” Tamba M. Abu, Assistant Physician at Macauley Street Satellite Hospital told this press.\nAccording to the Matron and Medical Superintendent at the hospital, they are mindful that people are at risk and that this is why they have not only chlorinated the room where the victim was admitted but have done the same to the entire facility. “The hospital is in close surveillance for signs and symptoms from patients coming to the hospital. We are conducting contact tracing on all those that were on observation at the facility. We have safely disposed all properties belonging to the victims by burning,” a health official said.\nIt should be recalled that a couple of weeks ago, a confirmed case of Ebola was detected at Sumaila Town but the victim was quickly taken away.\nHowever, there is a growing fear that with these Ebola escape cases becoming more frequent,\nthere is a growing risk of it spreading to unprotected persons and areas; little wonder that law enforcement agencies have been co-opted to help.\"\n\nhttp://www.sierraleonenewshunters.com/article/police-hunt-escaped-ebola-victim\n\n"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12.178688049316406,7.606872120756535]},"properties":{"name":"Mattru Jong hospital: An escaped ebola suspected patient ","description":"July 20\n\nPlease, help us to verify .\n\n\"Another patient has escaped from an isolation unit in Sierra Leone. This time, the patient escaped from a health facility in Mattru Jong, Bonthe. The SAD news though is that unlike the escaped suspected patient from Freetown's PCMH, whose blood tests results later showed negative, this escaped patient's blood results have tested POSITIVE for Ebola. Reports however indicate that the escaped patient has been sighted vomiting blood at a certain junction locality between Mattru Jong and Bo. He has now been collected from that junction and moved to Kenema Ebola ward.\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sylola/posts/748413415222091\n\n\"When the Ebola patient escaped from Mattru Jong this weekend, the medical authorities in Bonthe immediately raised the alarm.

Neither did they DENY it or worst of all, INSULT those who spoke of the escape.\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/sl.issues/permalink/699795853389539/"}}],"_storage":{"displayOnLoad":true,"name":"Suspected ebola case ","id":22617,"remoteData":{},"color":"Yellow"}}
