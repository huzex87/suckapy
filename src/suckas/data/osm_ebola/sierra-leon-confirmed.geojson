The DMO, Dr Alhaji S Turay also proposed the putting up of check points at some strategic entrance locations in the Bo City. The Paramount Chief Prince Lappia Boima accepted the first proposal of “not selling bush meat” in the city but held reservation towards the second proposal of check pointsTherefore, a Task Force has been set up in the city for monitoring the importation animals like “monkeys, baboons, bush cows,” from which bush meats could be attained. As at present, the Market Sellers Association has accepted the proposal too and is also helping with the monitoring of the sales of bush meat in both the markets and outside the market.\nhttp://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200525752.shtml\n\n July 10 2014 - MOHS\n\n\"...sample have been confirmed positive for Ebola ... from Bo\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=317202108456638&id=281064805403702\n\n July 10 2014 - United Methodist health center\n\n\"I am afraid that we are very likely to have more cases here in the Bo area following this development,” Saffa said, \"because once one is in regular contact with an Ebola patient for over one week, there is a high tendency that one would catch the disease.\"\n\nhttp://www.umc.org/news-and-media/ebola-outbreak-closes-united-methodist-health-center","name":"Confimed ebola case from Bo"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12.92266845703125,9.077687932437932]},"properties":{"name":"Kambia district: confirmed ebola cases","description":"Last info: July 17 2014 - US Embassy\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sierraleone.usembassy/posts/10152537187687866"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12.786712646484375,8.760902459519219]},"properties":{"_storage_options":{"color":"Red"},"name":"Port Loko : Ebola confirmed case","description":"MOHS - July 13 2014 \n\nConfirmed by an Ebola test.
